# internshipProject
School related project (IB Computer Science IA), first every website created using HTML, CSS and very limited JS

Things currently trying to improve:
  # Add a proper authentication rather than the simple dropdown
  # Improve the css files, make them simpler and create a main.css instead of different for every page
  # Use margin instead of padding for the text (margin did not function during last try)
